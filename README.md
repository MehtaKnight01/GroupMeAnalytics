GroupMeAnalytics
================

Groupme (https://groupme.com/) provides an awesome API (https://dev.groupme.com/docs/v3) that allows users to parse conversations in groups they are a part of.

How to use it?
Steps for running it on your local machine:
-Get your groupme API key using your regular account credentials by logging in here: https://dev.groupme.com/session/new
-Click the shiny orange button "Create Application" and fill out the form. Doesn't matter what you put in these fields, for the callback URL you can simply put in "https://example.com/oauth_callback"
-After that, go to your application page and you will see your access token
-Grab python 2.7.x (not compatible with python 3.4.x) from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
-Clone the code from this repo and copy in your API token when the python app prompts you

Screw that, I WANT IT NOW:
